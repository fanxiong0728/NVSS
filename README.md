### Statistical Disclosure Control

From CDC Wonder the following statistical disclosure control is usually employed:

**Provisional Multiple Cause of Death Data:** "Statistics representing one through nine (1-9) deaths are suppressed, in the provisional mortality online database for years 2018 and later. Additional privacy constraints apply to infant mortality statistics for infant age groups and live births denominator population figures. See [Assurance of Confidentiality](#0) for more information."

**Current Final** **Multiple Cause of Death Data:** "Statistics representing fewer than ten (one to nine) deaths or births are suppressed. Population figures are also suppressed when the population represents fewer than ten persons. Additional privacy constraints apply to infant mortality statistics for infant age groups and live births denominator population figures. See Assurance of Confidentiality for more information."
